# Learn how to use the Command line

If MassMine is the first command line software that you have used, we recommend completing an introductory command line tutorial. The tutorial offered by Code Academy is easy to follow and can be completed in about 30-45 minutes. The main things you need to learn from this (or any other command line tutorial) are how to navigate the directories within your computer (`cd`), how to copy/move/delete files when necessary (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`), how to list the files in your relative directory (`ls`), and how to find the current folder you are working within (`pwd`).

The Code Academy command line tutorial is available here: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>
