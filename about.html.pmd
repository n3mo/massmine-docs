MassMine was created by [Nicholas Van Horn](http://www.nicholasvanhorn.com) and [Aaron Beveridge](http://www.aaronbeveridge.com). MassMine is a TRACE Innovation Initiative, and the project is supported by the George A. Smarthers Libraries and Research Computing at the University of Florida. 

MassMine's entire project team, advisory board, and scholary contributors can be seen here---in our recent [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00025642/00001/pdf) grant application.
