◊h3{Project Team} 

MassMine benefits from the collaborative effort of a number of developers and researchers involved in the creation, testing, and application of the software as a research tool. Many individuals have contributed in tangible and intangible ways, but several deserve recognition for their direct involvement in the project.

    ◊dd{Nick is the co-creator of MassMine along with Aaron Beveridge. He is an active researcher in the interdisciplinary field of computational cognitive neuroscience. His work in this area includes research related to neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics, computer vision, artificial intelligence, mathematical modeling, as well computer science more broadly construed. In parallel with this research, he actively writes and maintains open source software related to such topics as writing and productivity, typography, statistical analysis, and tools for automated text processing. This work in part has led to the development of MassMine, for which he remains the lead software developer.}

    ◊dd{Aaron is the co-creator of MassMine along with Nicholas Van Horn. His research investigates the intersection of data science and humanities research paradigms---focusing on the importance of tool creation and software development as they motivate the ongoing expansion of available research methodologies in the digital humanities. With an emphasis on writing studies and circulation studies, his current project tests theories of hyper-circulation as they attempt to explain the delivery and recirculation of digital media within complex networks. He presented his work with MassMine at the largest international conference for writing studies, rhetoric and composition, the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC 2014), and he has been accepted to present an update of the software along with new data analysis at the same conference in 2015. He is currently working with the George A. Smathers libraries at the University of Florida to develop trainings for the Scott Nygren Scholars Studio (a Digital Humanities lab) to teach Arduino microcontroller programming/prototyping, and an additional set of trainings that teach text mining and natural language processing.}
